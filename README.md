# Gas mileage predictor app

This repos contains the R code for a Shiny app created for the
Developing Data Products course on Coursera.

The app predicts gas mileage of cars based on five predictors
using the `mpg` data set in the R package `ggplot2` using a GLM.

The app is hosted here:

A presentation "pitch" for the app can be viewed at Rpubs:
